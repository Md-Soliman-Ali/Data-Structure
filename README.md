# Data-Structure
A collection of algorithms for data structure manipulation in C++

                                                                 slide_1
Write a C program to create an array of N elements.
Insert , Update and Delete from any specific position of that array.

Sample Input:
N=5
1 2 5 7 8

Insert: 2(position)
        9(element)

Output: 1 2 9 5 7 8

Sample Input:
N=5
1 2 5 7 8

Delete: 2(position)

Output: 1 2 7 8

                                                                 slide_2
Write a C program to create a linked list of N elements and display the elements in the linked list.

Sample Input:
N=5
1 2 5 7 8

Output: 1=> 2 => 5=> 7=> 8

                                                                 slide_3
Write a C program to search a specific element in a linked list of N elements and display the position of the element in the linked list.

Sample Input:
N=5
1 2 5 7 8

Output: 5 is in position 3

                                                                 slide_4
Write a C program to create a stack of N elements; insert n elements in the stack and display the elements of the stack.

Sample Input:
N=5
1 2 5 7 8

Output: 8 7 5 2 1

                                                                 slide_5
Write a C program to convert a infix expression into a postfix one.

Sample Input:
(A+B)*(C-D)

Output: A B + C D - *

*** Hints:
 If operand then push into stack. 
 If operator ( ^, +, -, *, / ) then pop two operands and do the operation and push into stack. 

                                                                 slide_6
Write a C program to create a queue of N elements; insert n elements in the queue(enqueue) and display the elements of the queue(dequeue).

Sample Input:
N=5
1 2 5 7 8

Output: 1 2 5 7 8

                                                                 slide_7
Write a C program to create a binary tree using array.

Sample Input:
N=7
1 2 5 7 8 9 10

Output: 1
			 2 5 
		7 8 9 10
